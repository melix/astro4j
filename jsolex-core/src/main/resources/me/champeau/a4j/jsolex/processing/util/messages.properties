recon.description=This is the reconstructed image, applying a pixel shift of %.2f pixels from the center of the detected spectral line. No other processing is applied (in particular no geometry correction).
geometry.corrected.description=This image is the result of reconstructing the image with a pixel shift of %.2f pixels from the center of the detected spectral line, then applying geometry correction in order to get a round disk.
activeregions.description=This image shows an overlay of the detected active regions on the solar disk. Note that this can be inaccurrate, in particular if the source image is blurry. If the image contains very large areas (square or rectangular) then it is likely to be wrong. \
  The labels will only be accurately positioned if you have correctly oriented the image (North up, East left), that you can check by looking at the GONG tab. \
  In addition, if you are using an alt-az mount, then you must have checked the option and entered the correct coordinates of the observation site. \
  Labels in BLUE are for regions which were detected directly by JSol'Ex. Labels in RED are for regions which appear in the SRS data but were not detected by JSol'Ex.
redshift.description=This image shows the areas of the solar disk where significant redshifts have been detected. You should never take for granted this image, since it is based on an algorithm which analyzes the spectral lines and can therefore make mistakes. \
  It is a good indication of where to look for interesting phenomena, but it is not a scientific measurement. \
  In particular, the algorithm may accidently detect redshifts where there are none, or miss some redshifts. \
  The interpretation of the phenonemon should also be done with caution, in particular the computed speeds. \
  It is recommended to check on online databases if events like eruptions or flares have been reported at the time of the observation to confirm the interpretation.
colorized.description=A colorized version of the image at pixel shift %.2f. The colorization is not a scientific process, it is only meant to make the image more appealing. \
  Also note that while they can be visually attractive, colorized images tend to significantly reduce the contrast of the image, which can make it harder to see details. \
  Automatic colorization is also based on the detected spectral ray, which will only be accurate if you have correctly set the pixel size of your camera.
negative.description=A negative version of the image at pixel shift %.2f. Negative images can make some details like filaments or prominences more visible.
protus.description=This image is obtained by applying a mask on the disk, then enhancing the contrast of the prominences.
technical.card.description=This image is obtained by applying an overlay grid on the disk, showing the orientation of the sun. \
  It will only be accurate if the image is correctly oriented (North up, East left), that you can check by looking at the GONG tab. \
  In addition, if you are using an alt-az mount, then you must have checked the option and entered the correct coordinates of the observation site.
mix.description=An image which mixes the colorized version and the prominences image in order to show both at the same time.
doppler.description=This image is synthetized by combining 2 images obtained on the blue wing and red wing of the spectral line. \
  It can be used to show the rotation of the sun and features which are moving towards or away from the observer. \
  Note that you may have to invert the red and blue channels to get the conventional colors, which are blue for features moving towards the observer and red for features moving away.
doppler.eclipse.description=This image combines the Doppler image with a disk mask, in order to highlight the relative movements of the prominences. \
  Note that you may have to invert the red and blue channels to get the conventional colors, which are blue for features moving towards the observer and red for features moving away.
edge.detection.description=This is a debug image which shows how the edges of the solar disk have been detected. \
  Wrong edge detection will cause incorrect geometry correction.
average.image.description=This is a debug image showing the average image of the solar disk, that is to say the average of frames where signal of the sun was detected. \
  This image is used to compute the polynomial which represents the distorsion of the image.
individual.redshift.image.description=This image is a frame of the video where a remarkable redshift has been detected. \
  Redshift detection is subject to caution and can be wrong. \
  Also always be careful when interpreting the results of redshift detection, in particular the computed speeds, since such phenomena can be caused by various factors.
tilt.detection.description=This image is a debug image showing how the tilt of the solar disk has been detected. \
  Wrong tilt detection will cause incorrect geometry correction. \
  Tilt can be fixed by rotating the camera and should be ideally less than 1°.
mosaic.description=A reconstructed image obtained by stitching together multiple images.
ellipse.fitting.failed=Unable to perform ellipse regression, which means that the sun disk couldn't be properly detected.
