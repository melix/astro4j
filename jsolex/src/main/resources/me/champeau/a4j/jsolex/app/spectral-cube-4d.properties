# Spectral Cube 4D Help Overlay

help.title=How the 4D Spectral Viewer Works
help.text=The 4D viewer lets you explore a spectral data cube by **slicing through different dimensions**.\n\n\
**Wavelength slice**: Shows the reconstructed solar disk at a specific wavelength. Moving the slider allows exploring the wings of the studied line.\n\n\
**Frame/Slit slice**: Shows a 3D spectral profile surface with the characteristic absorption valley.\n\n\
The default view, the wavelength slice, will show something that very much resembles a reconstructed solar image, when seen from above, except that instead of using a pixel value in 2d to represent the intensity, we use the height in 3d to represent that intensity.\n\n\
This viewer uses **raw, unmodified data**: if the X/Y ratio or tilt correction isn't properly set, the disk may appear oval or distorted.\n\n\
The scaling of intensity can be changed using the scale selector, which can help reveal more subtle features.\n\n\
The frame/slit slice shows a surface where the X axis is the slit position (or frame number): this will show how the spectral profile varies along the slit (or over "scan" time, if frame number is selected). The wavelength axis is the spectral dimension, and the height again represents intensity. The absorption line will appear as a valley in this surface.\n\n\
Use the **mouse to rotate** the view and the **scroll wheel to zoom**.
