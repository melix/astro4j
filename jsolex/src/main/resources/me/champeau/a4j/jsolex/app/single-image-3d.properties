help.title=Understanding this 3d view
help.text=When we observe the Sun from Earth, the light rays are nearly parallel, producing an image similar to an orthographic projection (like a flat map of a globe). This has a limitation: features near the disk center appear at their true scale, while features near the limb appear compressed due to foreshortening. This 3D view maps the flat image onto a hemisphere. By rotating the view, you can better appreciate the **true dimensions** of solar features across the curved surface.\n\nProminences projection is by nature **inaccurate**. Since they do not appear on the disk, we have no indication of where they actually are or in which direction they extend. Therefore, they are projected as a ring around the globe.
