help.title=Understanding this 3D view
help.text=When we observe the Sun from Earth, the light rays are nearly parallel, producing an image similar to an orthographic projection (like a flat map of a globe). This has a limitation: features near the disk center appear at their true scale, while features near the limb appear compressed due to foreshortening. This 3D view maps the flat image onto a hemisphere. By rotating the view, you can better appreciate the **true dimensions** of solar features across the curved surface.\n\nProminences projection is by nature **inaccurate**. Since they do not appear on the disk, we have no indication of where they actually are or in which direction they extend. Therefore, they are projected as a ring around the globe.

help.diagram.phase1.title=1. What we see from Earth
help.diagram.phase1.explain1=The Sun is so far away that light rays reaching us
help.diagram.phase1.explain2=are nearly parallel. This produces an orthographic projection.
help.diagram.phase1.explain3=We only see the visible surface - nothing behind it.
help.diagram.phase2.title=2. The flat disk image we capture
help.diagram.phase2.explain1=Our camera captures a flat 2D image of the Sun.
help.diagram.phase2.explain2=All features appear projected onto this flat disk.
help.diagram.phase2.explain3=This flat image is ALL the data we have.
help.diagram.phase3.title=3. Mapping flat image onto hemisphere
help.diagram.phase3.explain1=We project the flat image onto a 3D hemisphere.
help.diagram.phase3.explain2=This corrects foreshortening near the limb.
help.diagram.phase3.explain3=Features now appear at their true angular size.
help.diagram.phase4.title=4. What we cannot see
help.diagram.phase4.explain1=Important: We do NOT invent hidden data!
help.diagram.phase4.explain2=Filaments extending toward/away from us appear flat.
help.diagram.phase4.explain3=Their real depth is invisible in the original image.
help.diagram.phase4.explain4=The 3D view only reorganizes visible data - it cannot reveal hidden structures.
