# Spectral Profile 3D Help Overlay

help.title=How the 3D Spectral Profile Works
help.text=The 3D profile displays **intensity as a function of slit position and wavelength**.\n\n\
Each vertical column of the averaged spectrum already contains a complete intensity profile. The absorption line creates a valley in the 3D surface.\n\n\
**How to interpret**: The valley shows the spectral line absorption. Tilts may indicate Doppler shifts. \
Intensity variations along the slit axis may reveal instrumental effects (dust, vignetting, slit uniformity).\n\n\
Use the **mouse to rotate** the view and the **scroll wheel to zoom**.

# Phase 1: Averaged spectrum with curved line
phase1.title=Step 1: Averaged Spectrum
phase1.averaged.spectrum=Averaged spectrum (all frames)
phase1.slit.position=Slit position (X)
phase1.one.column=1 column
phase1.explain=Each vertical column contains intensity vs wavelength
phase1.explain2=The absorption line appears curved

# Phase 2: Column extraction
phase2.title=Step 2: Column = Intensity Profile
phase2.one.column=One column
phase2.intensity=Intensity
phase2.absorption=Absorption
phase2.explain=Reading a column gives intensity along wavelength
phase2.explain2=The dip shows where absorption occurs
